# Ygo-Omega-Modular-for-Linux

This is just a modular version of YGO_Omega for Debian based Linux Systems. In order for this package to operate you must have the Vulkan dependency installed. 

**** There is a Walk-thru of how to install Vulkan on your system located at Https://Forum.Duelistsunite.ORG/ ****

**Setup**

1st.
  Make a folder of your choosing to hold all the game files for YGO Omega. Call it whatever you like, we arent restricted to named files on Linux.

2nd.
  Extract the contents of this file to that file.

3rd.
There should be no need to modify any of the files contained in this package. Feel free to run the OmegaUpdater.x86_64 after you have extracted all files into your directory just to ensure that it is up-to-date. I am doing my best to keep the modular file updated, but I am not perfect and do not have a lot of free time.

4th.
After you have extracted all files feel free to open your folder in ther terminal and run ./install.sh. This will make a shortcut to YGO Omega on your APP menu.

5th.
If you have any issues feel free to ask myself (SamuelB) or another staff member of the YGO Omega Discord to help you finish your installation. At the end of the day we just want everyone to be able to play and enjoy the game.

Thanks,


SamuelB
